I spent 40 days in South Africa, so we then we had some time to get to know each other. When I came back home to Brazil, I thought ‘Wow! I love cats’ from ‘I hate cats.’” Andrea then adopted a rescue cat, now 14 years’ old named Tabby, and today has two others Sofia and Serafin.",

I realized that wasn’t the reality at all and started looking at products available around the world. Everything you would find was something made for dogs.”",
