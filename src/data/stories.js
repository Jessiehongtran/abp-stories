At first, he didn’t realize that his posted ads were going widely. The result was that he spent more money than he needed either trying to reach individuals who weren’t interested in buying from him, engaging people not in his market, or people would call with time-consuming questions.  “My current return on investment for ads that I run on Facebook and Instagram is averaging about 500%,” says Frank. “Before, it was hit or miss.”"

Many of my customers buy from me time and time again, and my loyal following is due in part to my service to the community. “"

Primarily targeting women between the ages of 24-45 years, they allocate 90% of their marketing to Facebook and Instagram each month, and credit 10% of their sales to the platforms."
